philosophy, express, read, recording, safety, sound, teacher, teaching, transportation experience 09/2010 to 09/2011 information technology analyst company name i believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning. designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. i believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum. letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them. my personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets. students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity. i would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each childs needs and interests. curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and themselves. motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child. recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the children. giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a great feeling. giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child. developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions. make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable. giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend more time in school than any other place. i believe in the quote a strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong, i would encourage more of the outdoor activities during the supporting weather. i feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in outdoor group activities. a healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy foods, and less sodium and sugar. i would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher. i understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children. enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school leaving the parents. my philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place. 01/2010 to 08/2010 technology analyst company name 10/2006

which supports university of missouri system faculty and students through agile and rapid creation of new applications. projects: atlas: description: this project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions. there are three roles tied to application they are tutee, tutor, and scheduler. a tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through availability grid and tutor submits availability. a scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. also, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. the other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day. responsibilities: created a availability calendar grid. in grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. clicking on the cell toggles the availability. automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data) developed c# console application for scheduled email task. got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. created class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both console application for schedule task and web
